# Pulsed-magnet

This code was written to model the magnetic field from different configurations of the Helmholtz coils using the Biot-Savart Law. This result was aid the design of a pulse field magnet powered by a discharge capacitor bank. Note that the parametric equations of the curve can be changed, which can model different shapes - not only the Helmholtz coils.
